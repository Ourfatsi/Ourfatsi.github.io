# Banach method

## Remarks

### Difficulties encountered in using Banach method, key pinpoints.

    - Using python code to make a synthesis of the four basic methods of approximation.
    - Using Geogebra and learning iteration scripting:
        - Iteration : ItérationListe((h(x(V), M), 0), V, {X}, k)
            - (h(x(V), M : point. x(V), the x coordinate of the variable V.
            - If different variables: V,W and initial values {V1,W1}, etc.
            - k is the number of iterations. Needn’t to enter in the function, it is just the repetition times, each next entry takes previous output.
        - Sequences, cursors, dependent objects.
    - Correction reading of the exercise n°8:
        - As long as the interval is closed and any cord slope is bounded it is possible to calculate.
        - Draw attention in any interval of the function f is increasing,  if not take -f.
        - Conversion is possible.
